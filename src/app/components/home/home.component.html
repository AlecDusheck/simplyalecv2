        <p id="hello">Hi there,</p>
        <p>My name is Alec Dusheck, and I'm a developer at <a href="https://eitmn.com">ExperienceIT</a>.</p>
        <p>I want to use computer science and business to make the world a better place.
            I co-founded a non-profit named Connect To Care to raise awareness of youth homelessness.
            We run various programs to help our local Minneapolis homeless community.
            While working there, I've managed several projects, including our end-to-end <a href="https://volunteer.connect-tocare.org">volunteer platform</a>. and have been deeply involved in application design and
            development.
            To learn more about Connect To Care, visit our <a href="https://connect-tocare.org">website</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition, I've worked on several personal projects including <a href="https://github.com/SimplyServers">Simply
            Servers</a>, a full-on server management platform.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm currently a junior at <a href="https://www.edenpr.org">Eden Prairie High School</a>. I'm passionate about various subjects including mathematics and comparative politics.
            I enjoy inspiring others and giving them opportunities to get the education they deserve.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I'm a full-stack developer. My favorite programming language is Typescript, but also enjoy working with Java and PHP.</p>
